# Sales Data Analysis & Prediction (Python)

This repository contains three beginner-level Python projects built using the same sales dataset, progressing from basic exploratory analysis to simple forecasting and prediction.

## Projects Included

### 1. Exploratory Sales Analysis
- Loaded and cleaned multiple CSV files using Pandas
- Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
- Visualized sales trends over time using line and bar charts
- Practiced basic data cleaning and data understanding

### 2. Simple Sales Forecasting (Moving Average)
- Calculated weekly and monthly rolling averages
- Compared smoothed forecasts with actual sales
- Visualized trends in time-series sales data
- Applied basic forecasting concepts using Pandas

### 3. Sales Prediction using Linear Regression
- Selected relevant features such as date, promotions, and holidays
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a simple linear regression model
- Evaluated model performance and visualized actual vs predicted sales

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Multiple CSV files were used for analysis. The dataset is not included in this repository; all data previews, outputs, and visualizations are available within the notebooks.
